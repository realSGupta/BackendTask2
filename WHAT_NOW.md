# ⏰ NEXT STEPS (Right Now!)

## Step 1: Wait 1-2 Minutes for Railway Deploy

Railway should be deploying your server now!

**Check at:** https://backendtask2-production.up.railway.app

If you see a page with "Order Execution Engine - Deployed on Railway!" → ✅ SUCCESS!

---

## Step 2: Once Deployment Works → Record Video!

You now have BOTH:
- ✅ Local: http://localhost:3000 (running for 48+ minutes!)
- ✅ Deployed: https://backendtask2-production.up.railway.app

### Quick Video Recording (5 min):

**Press Win + G** and follow this:

```
[00:00] Show local: http://localhost:3000
       "This is my Order Execution Engine for Solana DEX"

[00:15] Explain: "Market Orders for real-time routing demo"

[00:25] New terminal → Run: node demo-concurrent-orders.js
       "Submitting 5 concurrent orders"

[00:45] Show server logs with routing decisions

[01:00] Show deployed version: backendtask2-production.up.railway.app
       "Deployed on Railway with full documentation"

[01:15] "GitHub: github.com/realSGupta/BackendTask2"
       "Thanks for watching!"
```

**Upload to YouTube → Give me the link → DONE!**

## 🎯 Current Status:

✅ 7/8 Deliverables Complete
⏳ Last thing: Video (5 minutes!)

## Check Deployment Now:

Go to: https://backendtask2-production.up.railway.app

**Does it work?** Tell me:
