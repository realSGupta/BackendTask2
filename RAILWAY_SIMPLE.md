## 🎯 SIMPLIFIED: Just Get the URL

Actually, since your Railway project is already created and your service is deployed,
you might not even need PostgreSQL and Redis for the demo!

## FASTEST PATH - Get Public URL Only (2 minutes):

1. **On your Railway page** (you have it open)

2. **Find your BackendTask2 service** (the card/box showing your app)

3. **Click on it**

4. **Look for "Settings" tab** at the top → Click it

5. **Scroll to "Networking" or "Domains" section**

6. **Click "Generate Domain"**

7. **Copy the URL** that appears

8. **Paste it here**: "Railway URL: [your-url]"

## That's It!

The demo server you have running locally works perfectly without databases.
Your Railway deployment will work the same way!

**Just need the public URL to complete the deliverable!**

Tell me: **Do you see a "Generate Domain" button on your Railway page?**
